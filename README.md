============
FIRST Team 701 the RoboVikes Statistical Analysis Database (SAD)

Inspired by the Chadabase, founded by the RoboVikes' Chad Eatman, SAD is designed to take scouting data collected at FRC Competitions and organize it for the best viewing experience.  SAD also runs statistics on the data collected, allowing it to rank teams by individual performance in offense, defense, autonomous, etc., provide graphs of a team's performance throughout a competition, search for teams that meet user criteria, and even compare alliances to predict match outcomes and provide teams with possible winning strategies.

SAD focuses on providing a fluid user interface and effienct data handling, two things the Chadabase lacked.  SAD is scheduled to launch by the end of the 2014 FRC Build Season.
